<p>I am currently a Humanities Librarian at <a href="https://www.lib.fsu.edu//">Florida State University Libraries</a> serving as liaison to the departments of History, Philosophy, and Religion. In this role, I provide research support, information literacy instruction, and collection development in these disciplines.</p> 

<p>My current research interests include critical pedagogy, ethical assessment and research in libraries, and the historical relationship of archives and libraries to colonialism.</p>

<p>I am also a historian, working toward a Ph.D. in History at Florida State University. I amd studying in the fields of Atlantic world, early America, and public history while I focus on the historical assembly of archives and their effects on the practice of history research.</p>

<p>My dual identities inform my intellectual interests. Just as the assembly of archives sets the infrastructure that historians must navigate in order to know the past, so too do established historical narratives shape how archives are assembled. I seek to illuminate for historians the systems and knowledge infrastructure that I maintain as a librarian, and to use the historian's sensibilities to contextualize and denaturalize long-standing library practices.</p>

<p>I am also influenced by my location on the Gulf Coast, home for most of my adult life. A long time resident of New Orleans, Louisiana, and now living in the Panhandle of Florida, my research and practice are both situated in the contexts of the Gulf South.</p>
