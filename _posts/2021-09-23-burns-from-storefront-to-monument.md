*In the Fall 2021 semester, I am taking a course on Public History theory and methods with Dr. Jennifer Koslow at Florida State University. This post is the second of several entries in which I will respond to our assigned course readings. These posts are official assignments for class, thus they conform to assignment criteria. Most notably, they are supposed to be limited to 200-250 words. Enjoy!*

### Andrea A. Burns *From Storefront to Monument: Tracing the Public History of the Black Museum Movement*.
Andrea A. Burns *From Storefront to Monument: Tracing the Public History of the Black Museum Movement*. Amherts: University of Massachusetts Press, 2013.

In the mid-twentieth century, museum professionals began shifting their approach from creating "temples," spaces where visitors consume content, to "forums," which invite museum patrons to participate by also creating and critiquing knowledge.<sup>1</sup> According to Andrea Burns, this shift was in no small part due to the innovations and efforts of the Black museum movement that flourished in the 1960s and 1970s. As an influence on and integral part of the Black Power movement, Black neighborhood museums were grassroots organization steeped in community engagement and empowerment, all in service of reclaiming African American history and identity from the mainstream museums that ignored or minimized their stories. Sites like the DuSable Museum in Chicago, the International Afro-American Museum (IAM) in Detroit, and the Anacostia Neighborhood Museum in southeastern D. C. provided much needed intellectual space for Black communities to preserve and narrate their own local histories and thereby resist and respond to the overwhelmingly white narratives of mainstream museums and white supremacy throughout American institutions. 

Burns contrasts the grassroots origins of these three neighborhood museums with the more politically fraught African American Museum in Philadelphia, which arose in conjunction with the Bicentennial celebrations of 1976, and after the relative decline of the Black Power movement. In this case, Black community leaders still demanded control of their own narrative, but due to the project's connection to city politics and funding, had to fight for that control at every turn. The experience in Philadelphia foreshadows the other major theme in Burns's study. These innovative museums each faced challenges to their core missions when they expanded or relocating to more prominent locations, transitioned from the dynamic leadership of their founding to become institutions with governing boards, and at times struggled with their own success when more "mainstream" museums with better funding and professional networks began to tell the African American story, leaving the neighborhood museums behind. 

And therein lies the most interesting tension explored in Burns's book. The Black museum movement drew its energy and participatory innovation from being on the "peripheral edge," a space of fugitivity and creativity rooted in communities ignored or maligned by white society and centers of power. But does that mean they must remain on the periphery in order to sustain that innovative and community-centered mission? Burns suggest that the National Museum of African American History and Culture (NMAAHC) may test this proposition as this member of the Smithsonian establishment attempts to present Black stories to a national audience.
