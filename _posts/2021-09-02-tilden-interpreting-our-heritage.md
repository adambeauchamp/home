*In the Fall 2021 semester, I am taking a course on Public History theory and methods with Dr. Jennifer Koslow at Florida State University. This post is the first of several entries in which I will respond to our assigned course readings. These posts are official assignments for class, thus they conform to assignment criteria. Most notably, they are limited to 200-250 words. Enjoy!*

### Freeman Tilden. *Interpreting Our Heritage*.
Freeman Tilden. *Interpreting Our Hertiage,* 4th ed. Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2007.

Freeman Tilden's classic work, *Interpreting Our Heritage*, has been required reading for National Park Service interpreters and public historians since its publication a half-century ago. It is easy to understand why. In prose that evokes the American transcendentalists he so often cites, Tilden lays out the philosophical underpinnings of “interpretation,” the practice of revealing meaning and relationships through first-hand experience with historical objects and spaces. Tilden elaborates his philosophy of interpretation in six core principles, which I list below for reference.

Tilden calls on interpreters to create revelatory experiences for visitors to parks and museums. Throughout the text, he contrasts the interpreter with the “educator,” a stodgy lecturer that must have been the norm in Tilden’s day. The role of the interpreter is not to teach, but rather to inspire, to facilitate experiential learning for visitors of all ages. According to Tilden, interpreters should connect historical and natural sites to visitors’ lived experiences and to the whole of their personalities, moods, and interests.

I recognize Tilden’s sound pedagogical advice and appreciate his uplifting prose. However, reading Tilden today I cannot help but feel that his goals are a bit dated. Tilden’s call for experiential learning is no longer radical, and his caricature of formal education seems a straw man. Furthermore, his reliance on creating personal connections between visitors and the past fails to account for times when those associations may be painful. His sympathetic vignette of Robert E. Lee and references to prehistoric Indians assume a particular narrative of American history and skirt the hard truths of settler colonialism and slavery. 

Tilden’s appeal for transcendent public history experiences was pedagogically ahead of its time, but his text must be read in conversation with examples that speak to more diverse audiences than Tilden may have had in mind.

### Tilden's Six Principles
1. Any interpretation that does not somehow relate what is being displayed or described to something within the personality or experience of the visitor will be sterile.
2. Information, as such, is not interpretation. Interpretation is revelation based upon information. But they are entirely different things. However, all interpretation includes information.
3. Interpretation is an art, which combines many arts, whether the material presented are scientific, historical, or architectural. Any art is in some degree teachable.
4. The chief aim of interpretation is not instruction, but provocation.
5. Interpretation should aim to present a whole rather than a part and must address itself to the whole man rather than any phase.
6. Interpretation addressed to children (say, up to the age of twelve) should not be a dilution of the presentations to adults but should follow a fundamentally different approach. To be at its best it will require a separate program.
