### Tammy S. Gordon, *The Mass Production of Memory: Travel and Personal Archiving in the Age of the Kodak*
Amherst: University of Massachusetts Press, 2020.

Do you take vacation photos? What do you take pictures of when you travel? The vacation shots of landscapes, architecture, and family and friends on holiday are so ubiquitous as to become clich√©, but as Tammy S. Gordon reveals in this fascinating study, the origins of the humble travel picture are enmeshed in the histories of mass comsumption, technology, as well as class, gender, and race differences in the United States. By analyzing troves of vernacular travel photos from the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the dawn of the Kodak era and broad popular access to camera technology, Gordon shows that Kodak's marketing strategies reflected the legacy of elite Grand Tours. As a result, Kodak mass produced not only cameras and film, but also the style and content of the photos taken by white, middle-class travelers. These privileged Americans claimed space and special access to modernity as they snapped photos of historical architecture and the people they encountered and deemed less modern.

Conversely, Gordon discovers that photos taken by Native American, African American, and gender nonconforming travelers focused their lenses more on family and friends, framing people more often as individuals than stock characters in an imperial fantasy. Photography for these tourists, whose access to public spaces was often mediated by the dangers of racism and homophobia, was "an opportunity to edit bigotry out of the frame and to narrow the focus on community and individuality." (96) Gordon's examination of the interplay between Kodak's white, middle-class marketing strategy and the modes in which camera technology was deployed by a much more diverse American consumer base is a particularly interesting theme of this book.

Gordon ends her books with a call for historians to "get involved in efforts to preserve and make available more of the record of vernacular photography, and particularly travel photos that get devalued." (122) While Gordon's analysis has undoubtedly demonstrated the value of travel photos for understanding diverse cultural experiences, she does not address what it would mean to dramatically increase the number of family photos in public archives. Certainly archivists and other public historians do engage with their commmunities to support personal archiving and sharing historical photos, but to accession large numbers of photographs into archives presents resource challenges for institutions already strapped by years of underinvestment. I would have appreciated more attention to Gordon's experiences working in archives and histories of the collections she used in her study. How did these distinct collections of vernacular photos find their way into public archives, and what stories can archivists tell about them? Given her interest in personal archiving and buildling archival collections, Gordon's rich analysis of the photos themselves might have been even more powerful if contextualized with the stories of their assembly into archives as well.

Coda: In a timely coincidence, the podcast *99% Invisible* just released an episode called ["Shirley Cards"](https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/shirley-cards/) all about the technology of film and how it relates to race and skin color. It's a great pairing with Gordon's book, along with the excellent scholarship on this topic by Ruha Benjamin, author of [*Race After Technology*](https://www.ruhabenjamin.com/race-after-technology).
