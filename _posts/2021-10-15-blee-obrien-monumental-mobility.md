### Lisa Blee and Jean M. O'Brien, *Monumental Mobility: The Memory Work of Massasoit* 
Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2019.

Public monuments have the power to influence how we make meanings about the past. These meanings may be distinct from the historical realities they represent, or even the original intent of the monument builder, but that does not diminish the important role they play in this "memory work." This is the central theme of Lisa Blee and Jean M. O'Brien's fascinating work on *Massasoit*, Cyrus Dallin's bronze statue of 8s&#226;meeqan,<sup>1</sup> the Massasoit, or leader, of the Wampanoag confederacy who made an alliance of peace with the English settlers at Plymouth in 1621.

Commissioned in 1921 to commemorate the three-hundreth anniversary of the treaty, Dallin's statue conveyed his romantic memory of Native Americans, based on his childhood in Utah, as well as the ideals of masculinity prevalent in his day. For Dallin's patrons, the Improved Order of Red Men, a white fraternal organization, *Massasoit* represented the peaceful and patriotic role of 8s&#226;meeqan in the success of the Plymouth colony and the founding of the United States. For their (and our) settler colonial mythology, *Massasoit* contributes to an innocent, peaceful national origin story, the fantasy the fuels our Thanksgiving holiday. But *Massasoit*'s meaning and memory work shifted once again in 1970, when Wamsutta Frank James was disinvited from representing his Wampanoag tribe at the 350th anniversary celebrations at Plymouth because his speech was insufficiently patriotic. Instead, he delivered his critique of settler colonialism past and present at the foot of *Massasoit*, inaugurating an annual tradition of protest and inclusion of Wampanoag perspectives in the events of 1621 and modern American life.

In addition to its role in memory work, *Massasoit* has its own history as an object of art and as a commodity. Under questionable circumstances, several castings of the statue were made after Dallin's death, so that now there are versions of the statue in Kansas City, Dayton, Ohio, and on the campus of Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah, in addition to the original at Plymouth, Massachusetts. These posthumous castings, as well as plaster molds and miniature replicas sold to tourists have made *Massasoit* strangely mobile, and all the more malleable, as it contributes to the memory work of passersby and tourists.

Finally, I want to note that the authors acknowledge the contemporary context in which their book circulates, a time when monuments to conquistadors and Confederates are being questioned, reinterpreted, relocated, and even toppled by force. I lived in New Orleans during the years of debate over our several Confederate monuments. My house was one block away from the Jefferson Davis statue that towered over Canal Street in Mid-City. I watched the night of May 10, 2017 and into the next morning as a crew removed the statue from its pedestal. I drove past the neo-Confederate protesters who stood vigil for months on the empty plinth, AR-15s draped across their chests, the Stars and Bars fluttering behind them. I know from personal experience the power of public monuments, especially when they are on the move.

1. As explained in their footnote on page 219-20, the authors spell the Massasoit's name, 8s&#226;meeqan, using the orthography adopted by the [W&#226;pan&#226;ak Language Reclamation Program](https://www.wlrp.org/), and it is pronounced "Oo-sah-mee'-kwun." They do this also to distinguish between the historial figure, 8s&#226;meeqan, his title, the Massasoit, and the name of the statue, *Massasoit*.
