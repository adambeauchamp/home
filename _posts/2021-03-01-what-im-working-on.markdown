As a historian, I explore the historical assembly of archives about the Gulf coast region of the United States, espcially relating to the colonial and territorial periods of Louisiana and Florida. What we can know about the past is structured not only by archival sources, but also by the archival institutions that house, organize, and describe those sources. These aspects of archives are themselves part of sociohistorical processes that both shape and are shaped by historical knowledge.

I'm currently examining a published set of primary sources, *The Territorial Papers of the United States*, to consider how the selection of documents for publication and dissemination shapes the historical discourse about early Florida.

As a librarian, I am focused on how we assess library services in order to meet the needs of our diverse communities. This work takes two forms. First, I advocate for respecting library users' privacy when analyzing how library services are used and might be improved. My most recent research has focused on a critical review of learning analytics methods which some librarians have embraced. I suggest that the predictive goals of learning analytics are both methodologically unsound and in conflict with the library profession's ethics. 

Second, I am interested in methods for assessing library collections. Collections assessment often centers around budget dollars and usage statistics as librarians attempt to best meet the needs of library patrons within established budget constraints. What these measures often leave out, however, are questions of diversity, equity, and inclusion in library collections. Historically, libraries have upheld white supremacy through their collection-building choices. One of my current projects is an attempt to assess diversity and equity aspects of library holdings in order to remedy this problem and build more inclusive collections that both reflect our communities and advance knowledge creation.
